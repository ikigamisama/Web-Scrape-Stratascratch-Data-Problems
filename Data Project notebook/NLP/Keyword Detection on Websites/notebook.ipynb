    "<p>Your task is to create an algorithm, that takes html page as input and infers if the page contains the information about <code>cancer tumorboard</code> or not.\n",
    "What is a tumor board? Tumor Board is a consilium of doctors (usually from different disciplines) discussing cancer cases in their departments. If you want to know more please read this <a href=\"https://www.cancer.net/blog/2017-07/what-tumor-board-expert-qa\">article</a>.</p>\n",
    "<p>The expected result is a CSV file for test data with columns [<code>doc_id</code> and <code>prediction</code>].</p>\n",
    "<p><em>Bonus</em>: if you would like to go the extra mile in this task try to identify tumor board types <code>interdisciplinary</code>, <code>breast</code>, and any third type of tumor board up to you.  For these tumor boards please try to identify their schedule: Day (e.g. Friday), frequency (e.g. weekly, bi-weekly, monthly), and time when they start.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Data Description</h2>\n",
    "<p>You have <code>train.csv</code> and <code>test.csv</code> files and folder with corresponding <code>.html</code> files.</p>\n",

    "<li><code>htmls</code> contains files with names <code>{doc_id}.html</code></li>\n",
    "<li><code>keyword2tumor_type.csv</code> contains useful keywords for types of tumorboards</li>\n",

    "<p>Description of tumor board labels:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>1 (no evidence): tumor boards are not mentioned on the page</li>\n",
    "<li>2 (medium confidence): tumor boards are mentioned, but the page is not completely dedicated to tumor board description</li>\n",
    "<li>3 (high confidence): page is completely dedicated to the description of tumor board types and dates</li>\n",

    "<p>You are asked to prepare a model using htmls, referred to in <code>train.csv</code>, and make predictions for htmls from <code>test.csv</code></p>\n",
    "<h2>Practicalities</h2>\n",
    "<p>You should prepare a Jupyter Notebook with the code that you used for making the predictions and the following documentation:</p>\n",

    "<li>What metrics did you measure?</li>\n",
    "<li>How do you expect your model to perform on test data (in terms of your metrics)?</li>\n",
