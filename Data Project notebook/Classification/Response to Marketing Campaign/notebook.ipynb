They have given us a data set as a result of an email marketing campaign. The data set includes customer information, described below, as a well as whether the customer responded to the marketing campaign or not.</p>\n",
    "<p>Design a model that will be able to predict whether a customer will respond to the marketing campaign based on his/her information. In other words, predict the <code>responded</code> target variable described above based on all the input variables provided.</p>\n",
