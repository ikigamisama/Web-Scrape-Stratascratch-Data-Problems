    "<p>Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021. They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.</p>\n",
    "<h2>Assignment</h2>\n",
    "<p>The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.</p>\n",
    "<p>The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields;</li>\n",
    "<li>Make sense of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models on it.</li>\n",

    "<li><code>data</code> – tells whether the data is testing or training data</li>\n",
    "<li><code>trip_creation_time</code> – Timestamp of trip creation</li>\n",
    "<li><code>route_schedule_uuid</code> – unique Id for a particular route schedule</li>\n",
    "<li><code>route_type</code> – transportation type:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>FTL</code> – Full Truck Load: FTL shipments get to the destination sooner, as the truck is making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Carting</code> – handling system consisting of small vehicles (carts)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "</li>\n",
    "<li><code>trip_uuid</code> - unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers)</li>\n",

    "<li><code>source_name</code> – the name of a trip origin point</li>\n",
    "<li><code>destination_center</code> – destination ID</li>\n",
    "<li><code>destination_name</code> – destination Name</li>\n",
    "<li><code>od_start_time</code> – trip start time</li>\n",
    "<li><code>od_end_time</code> – trip end time</li>\n",
    "<li><code>start_scan_to_end_scan</code> – time taken to deliver from source to destination</li>\n",

    "<li><code>actual_time</code> – actual time taken to complete the delivery (cumulative)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>osrm_time</code> – an open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (given usual traffic) and gives the time estimate (cumulative)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>osrm_distance</code> – an open-source routing engine that computes the distance of the shortest path between points in a given map (cumulative)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>factor</code> – unknown field</li>\n",

    "<h2>Practicalities</h2>\n",
    "<p>Analyze the provided data and provide insights to the best of your abilities. Use statistical tests to support your claims. Include the relevant tables/graphs/visualization to explain what you have learned about the market. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process including the preparation of data - it is more important how the code is structured rather than just the final result or plot.</p></div>"
