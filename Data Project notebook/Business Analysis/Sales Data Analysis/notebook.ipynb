    "<h2>Assignment</h2>\n",
    "<p>Please answer the questions below based on the data provided:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Plot daily sales for all 50 weeks.</li>\n",
    "<li>It looks like there has been a sudden change in daily sales. What date did it occur?</li>\n",
    "<li>Is the change in daily sales at the date you selected statistically significant? If so, what is the p-value?</li>\n",
    "<li>Does the data suggest that the change in daily sales is due to a shift in the proportion of male-vs-female customers? Please use plots to support your answer (a rigorous statistical analysis is not necessary).</li>\n",
    "<li>Assume a given day is divided into four dayparts:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>night (12:00AM - 6:00AM),</li>\n",
    "<li>morning (6:00AM - 12:00PM),</li>\n",
    "<li>afternoon (12:00PM - 6:00PM),</li>\n",
    "<li>evening (6:00PM - 12:00AM).</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "What is the percentage of sales in each daypart over all 50 weeks?</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<h2>Data Description</h2>\n",
    "<p>The <code>datasets/</code> directory contains fifty CSV files (one per week) of timestamped sales data. Each row in a file has two columns:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>sale_time</code> - The timestamp on which the sale was made e.g. <code>2012-10-01 01:42:22</code></li>\n",
    "<li><code>purchaser_gender</code> - The gender of the person who purchased (male or female)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h2>Practicalities</h2>\n",
    "<p>Please work on the questions in the displayed order. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final answers. You are expected to spend no more than 1-2 hours solving this project.</p></div>"
