    "<h2>Assignment</h2>\n",
    "<p>The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?</p>\n",
    "<h2>Data Description</h2>\n",
    "<p>The company collected the transactional data of customers who purchased products from Walmart Stores during Black Friday. The dataset in <code>walmart_data.csv</code> has the following features:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>User_ID</code></li>\n",
    "<li><code>Product_ID</code></li>\n",
    "<li><code>Gender</code> - sex of a customer</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Age</code> - age in bins</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Occupation</code> (masked)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>City_Category</code> - category of the city [A, B, C]</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Stay_In_Current_City_Years</code>: number of years a customer stays in their current city</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Marital_Status</code></li>\n",
    "<li><code>Product_Category</code> (masked)</li>\n",
    "<li><code>Purchase</code> - purchase amount</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<h2>Practicalities</h2>\n",
    "<p>For simplicity, you may assume that 50% of Walmart`s customer base are Male and the other 50% are Female.</p>\n",
    "<p>Analyze the provided data and provide insights to the best of your abilities. Include the relevant tables/graphs/visualization to explain what you have learned about the market. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process including the preparation of data - it is more important how the code is structured rather than just the final result or plot.</p></div>"
