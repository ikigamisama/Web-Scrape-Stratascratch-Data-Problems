    "<h2>Assignment</h2>\n",
    "<p>Analyze and compare the air pollution data from 2 stations: one in New York City (US) and one in Bogota (Columbia). Extract useful insights and include visualizations that support your findings.</p>\n",
    "<p>You can start by analyzing the data from each station individually. Perform a time series analysis on the pollution levels. When is pollution the highest and the lowest? Can you see any trends or seasonal patterns?</p>\n",
    "<p>Next, you may compare the PM2.5 pollution in both cities. Using a visualization, show at what times is the pollution level in New York higher than in Bogota. Can you see any trends or seasonal patterns? Are the two time series correlated?</p>\n",
    "<p>You are also encouraged to explore the pollution limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, based on <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/69477/WHO_SDE_PHE_OEH_06.02_eng.pdf;jsessionid=B6AFB5E27DBB7AF1C3693F8C0ED40109?sequence=1\">this document</a>. Is the annual mean pollution level in the two cities below the acceptable value defined by the WHO? Write an algorithm that detects the time when the 24-hour mean pollution level exceeds the acceptable value and use a visualization to demark these periods.</p>\n",
    "<p>Above are just suggestions of what you can extract from these data. Still, after analyzing the datasets, feel free to use your imagination and draw additional insightful conclusions!</p>\n",

    "<h2>Practicalities</h2>\n",
    "<p>Analyze the provided data and answer the questions to the best of your abilities. Include the relevant tables/graphs/visualization to explain and support your findings. Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process including the preparation of data - it is more important how the code is structured rather than just the final result or plot. You are expected to spend no more than 1-3 hours on this project.</p></div>"
